## Synopsis
**Krigg** and **Juff** are two **Vanorians**, a species similar to monkeys living on **Vano**. This planet has a technological level akin to Earth in the 1960s.

They are searching for Valentine, the human leader who has turned their planet into a dumping ground and notably destroyed their restaurant over a banana split. They will explore all the worlds ravaged by humans, create a webtoon, and post their graphic research on Instagram.

### Progression of the First Part
Humans arrive on the Vanorian planet, marking the first contact with aliens for the monkey-like species. Initially seen as saviors, the humans quickly turn the planet into a trash heap and exploit its resources without interfering in local affairs. Krigg and Juff, who own a diner famous for its banana splits, see their establishment trashed by Valentine, who was disappointed by their dessert. Outraged, our heroes decide to exact revenge by pursuing Valentine through space, which involves learning to pilot a human spacecraft with the help of a pilot from another oppressed race.

### Technology
#### The Humans
Earth has been devastated and must be evacuated. Scout fleets are sent to several systems to prepare for the arrival of colonists.

#### Scientific and Technological Explanation
Although we follow the perspective of the Vanorians, with a technological understanding limited to theirs, the humans themselves do not fully grasp their technology, managing only enough knowledge to operate their parts.

##### Interstellar Travel
Humans have developed technology to bypass the speed of light by transforming large planets into singularities, which serve as gateways to other systems, like Jupiter.

##### Conventional Travel
Outside of "lightways," human spacecraft are relatively slow and require orbital relays to manage planetary launches.

### Valentine
Admiral of the fleet **Escape Three**, she is characterized by her brutal pragmatism and unstable traits, being cannibalistic and bipolar. She is not seen as a natural leader but rather as a survivor indifferent to the consequences of her actions.

### Civilizations and Stereotypes
Visited civilizations must illustrate a contrast to unresolved human issues such as racism, sexism, and oppression, problems to which Valentine herself succumbs.

### Valentine's Fleet
The fleet, consisting of about 60,000 people, prepares the setup of colonists. It includes mining and construction ships, often pillaging planetary resources, like water.

### First Contact for Humans
The fleet wandered in space for 10 years before finding a viable system, a period marked by mutinies and cannibalism.

### Vano
Similar to Earth but with a moon causing large tides, this planet is rich in biodiversity and attracts many humans.

### The Vanorians
Unlike humans, various Vanorian species coexist and are capable of reproducing among themselves, despite size differences.
