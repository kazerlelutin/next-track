# Next Track Universe

## Introduction
In the aftermath of an unparalleled ecological disaster, society has crumbled, giving rise to a reshaped world built from centuries of salvage and rebirth.

## Society
Survivors have established isolated communities where roller derby has transcended sport, embodying cooperation and competition and becoming integral to civil reconstruction.

## Geography
A mosaic of micro-societies, each enclave carries its own rules and cultures. From secluded villages to derby-centric cities, every locale boasts a unique identity.

## Technology
Necessity has sparked innovation. Devoid of past luxuries, society has turned to novel tech solutions. Rollers represent human ingenuity, offering speed and adaptability.

## Culture
A new cultural tapestry weaves old with new. Local folklore celebrates derby heroes, with matches as much storytelling as they are sporting events.

This universe is ripe for tales of resilience, adventure, and self-discovery, seen through the lens of a sport essential for survival and cultural identity.
