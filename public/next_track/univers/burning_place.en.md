## Burning Place: The Spice Neurome

Burning Place is renowned for its extensive spice production, which forms the heart of its culture and economy. Local legend has it that the farmers once developed a chili so potent that its flavor lingered all the way to the next Neurome, hence the community's name. The spices from Burning Place are not only used in cooking but also serve as valuable trade items with other Neuromes, strengthening connections through the exchange of these highly sought-after goods.
