Every four years, the Derby World Contest brings together the top Camelot teams from each Neurome to compete in the ultimate arena.

The winners choose between taking control of the Coliseum Neurome, with exclusive rights to Supraversum and advanced technologies, or a chance to migrate to space colonies, offering a better life but with unforeseen challenges.

This tournament is not only a test of skill but also a high-stakes political and social battleground.
