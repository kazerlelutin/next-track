## Supraversum
Supraversum is an exotic material used as a powerful, easily divisible energy source into batteries. Each battery, similar in size to a standard battery, can output 300v for six hours and takes three hours to recharge. This technology is crucial for Neuromes and Camelots who use it to power their equipment.

## Technological Level
Technologies on the Moon and terrestrial bases are extremely advanced, featuring major improvements unknown to the public. On Earth, technologies aim for sustainability without microprocessors or fine electronics, favoring simple mechanical and electrical devices. Communications are made via light telegraphs, and the main transportation is by traceable motorquads, fitted to the user's shoes.
