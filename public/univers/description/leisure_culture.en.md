In the "Next Track" universe, board games, books, and comics are prevalent cultural elements. These items are exchanged among Neuromes through Camelots or by traveling theater troupes. These troupes, often from dissolved Neuromes without a fixed residence, carry books, comics, games, and their theatrical equipment, enriching the cultural life of each community they visit.
