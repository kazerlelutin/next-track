## The Raconteurs: Time Travelers and Dimensional Guardians
The Raconteurs are a mysterious group of ten cloned individuals, continuously renewing themselves to preserve and transmit knowledge through the ages. They travel in a ship equipped with a unique distortion engine, the only one functional, allowing them to navigate at speeds equivalent to 100 times the speed of light by bending space. Thus, a journey to Trappist, which normally takes 140 years, only lasts five months for a Raconteur, while human societies evolve significantly between their visits. In addition to its distortion capabilities, their ship also allows interactions with the Transiteurs of the Supravers, offering potential access to planets within the same space-time. This ability to navigate realities makes the Raconteurs universal history keepers and key players in the interaction between different dimensions of the universe.
